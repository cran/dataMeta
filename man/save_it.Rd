\title{Save dataset with attributes.}
\usage{
save_it(x, name_of_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data.frame. Dataset that has attributes added, including a data dictionary.}

\item{name_of_file}{Text string to name the file.}
}
\value{
This function will save the dataset along with its attributes as an R
dataset (.rds) to the current working directory.
}
\description{
\code{save_it} saves datset with attributes stored as metadata as an R 
dataset (.rds) into the current working directory. This is the final function 
used in this package. For the function to run, the following parameters are needed.
